                        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Kayla Goldner, and I am currently a UCSD Extension Coding Boot Camp student.
                            My aspiration is to become a full stack web developer, and use these skills to assist others.
                            The majority of my occupational and educational background is composed of the medical field because
                            I truly enjoy helping people. I originally thought that I could only make a difference in the
                            lives of others, by literally saving their lives. I was enlightened by the idea that learning
                            the skills of a full stack web developer could also be used to improve the lives of others by
                            making workflow drastically easier and more efficient.
                        </p>

                        <p>I have a Bachelor of Science in Human Biology from the University of California San Diego with a
                            minor in psychology. I also have a license as an Emergency Medical Technician. I was not joking
                            when I said that I wanted to help people by literally saving their lives. With this transition,
                            I am also interested in continuing my education in this field by supplementing my studies with
                            UCSD Extension courses as languages go obsolete.
                        </p>
